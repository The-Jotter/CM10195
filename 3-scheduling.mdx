# Scheduling
## But what is scheduling?

Scheduling is the process of figuring out what process to run next.

This is a quite divisive issue with many different solutions.

We'll be focusing on sharing CPU time.

### Goals
* Service peripherals in a timely manner
* Understand various requirements of hardware: mice, keyboards are slow; memory is fast.
* Distribute work amongst multiple devices; e.g. CPU and newtork.
* Make best use of the hardware &mdash; efficient use.
* Use predictable behaviour
* Try to gracefully degrade over heavy load*
* **And do it all Quickly**

*Performing the best you can, whike trying to keep up.

### Measurements
To quantify the need of running a certain process, the OS can collect many measurements:
* CPU cycles used
* Memory used
* Disk used
* Network used
* Etc.

Some general measurements:
* Throughput &mdash; how many jobs finished in a given time.
* Turnaround &mdash; response times - is it snappy or sluggish?
* Real-time  &mdash; must handle data now.
* Money      &mdash; we're given money to complete this task within the next hour.
* Etc. 

## Scheduling Algorithms
### Run until completion
First in, first out: just run the tasks in order after the previous has finished.

* Good for large amounts of computation
* No multitasking overheads
* Not suitable for general-purpose computing

### Shortest Job First
Shortest-time-to-completeion runs next, wait until finished; repeat.

* No multitasking
* Good throughput
* Long jobs are delayed.
* Difficult to estimate how long a job takes to complete

### Cooperative Multitasking (+ Run until finished)
Each program decides when to give back control to the OS,
which then can resume another program.

* Non pre-emptive (OS doesn't intervine)
* Weak multitasking
* Uses a round-robin or similar algorithm to choose another task
* Programs must be "good citizen" programs &mdash; this can be both hard to write,
    and has no method to enforce this.

### Round Robin
Give each process a fixed amount of time, a *time slice*.
Once a program has ran out of time, the next program is allocated time.

* Multitasking
* Pre-emptive
* All processes have equal priority; this may not be ideal.
* Better interactivity then cooperative multitasking; but not ideal for interactivity.

### Shortest Remaining Time
Use time slicing, pick the program with the fewest time left.
* Pre-emptive
* Good throughput
* Long jobs can stil be starved

### Least Completed Next
OS chooses the process that has consumed the least amount of CPU time.

* All processes make equal progress (in terms of CPU time)
* Interactive processes get good attention.
* Long jobs can be starved.

## An Overview
Processes compete for resources, which the OS must handle.

From the program's perspective:
1. This demand is signaled to the OS by calling the kernel.
2. The program 'waits' for the kernel to reply.
3. The kernel replies, and program continues execution.

The OS, however does:
1. OS receives a system call.
2. It blocks the program.
3. It preforms other stuff.
4. It comes back to the program, and resumes execution.

### Deadlock 
Sometimes, the program never resumes.

Imagine the scenario:
1. Program 1 requests access to Disk 1 from the OS.
2. The OS replies, giving it control of D1. Then, it continues to P2.
3. Program 2 requests access to Disk 2 from the OS.
4. The OS replies, giving P2 access to Disk 2. Then, it continues to P1.
5. The OS goes back to P1, which now asks for access to D2!
6. The OS will mark the program as blocked to wait for P2.
7. Now, P2 is resumed: it wants D1 now!
8. The OS marks the task as blocked.

Now, both tasks are blocked and no-one makes progress: this is known as deadlock.

#### Coffman Conditions
These are conditions which deadlock will occur if they happen simultaneously:
* **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can use a resource at a time.
* **Hold-and-wait**: A process continues to hold a resource while waiting for other resources.
* **No preemption**: No resource is forcibly removed from a process by the OS.
* **Circular Wait**: There's a circular chain of processes where each holds a reource that's needed by the next.
