# Processes

## But, what what is a process ?
* executeable code;
* its data;
* associated information the OS needs to run it

Other terms include:
* tasks
* jobs

### Associated Information
* Where its code and data is stored in memory
* Program's permissions on parts of memory
* Resource management (CPU time, memory, I/O, networking):
    * How much \_\_\_\_ it's allocated
    * How much \_\_\_\_ has it used
* The CPU's PC and data registers
* Other factors

## Simplified States of a Process
| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| New   | Process just been created |
| Running | Currently executing on the CPU |
| Ready | Ready to run, but other processes (or OS) are using the CPU |
| Blocked | Waiting for some event or resource to become available |
| Exit | Process that has finished. |

This could be modelled as a finite-state machine.

### Time-Scheduling
OSes have a collection of processes and must keep track of (monitor) each processes' state.
Real OSes also will handle time-scheduling with more complexity &mdash; such as priorise
certain tasks over other. 

### A Typical state Transition
1. The OS decides to schedule a program that is `READY`.
2. The process is dispatched (OS marks as `RUNNING`) and begins execution
3. Process moves to `READY` state as:
    * The program may voluntarily suspend itself:
    relinquish; or
    * an interrupt may arise; or
    * a timer interrupt may happend (when the process has used all of its allocated CPU time.); or
    * the process needs some resource from the OS (communicated by a system call)
        and must wait until the resource is ready. The OS will move the process to `BLOCKED`.
4. If a `BLOCKED` process' data is ready, the CPU can un-suspend the process and mark it as `READY`. 

### The Process Control Block (PCB)
The kinds of data the OS needs to store/manage about processes:
* User identifiers (userids)
* priotrity
* stats like memory/CPU usage
* states of the registers when it last was suspended
